üë®‚Äçüíª About Me & My Profession

Technical Skills: Proficient in AutoCAD, Revit, Python, and SQL.

Data-Based Decision Making: Expert in using Excel and Power BI to track KPIs, identify trends, and provide actionable insights that prevent issues and improve project outcomes.

Compliance: Deep understanding of IS Codes and contractual standards.

üèóÔ∏è Professional Experience
Here are highlights and key project details from my past roles:

Key Project: High-Rise Residential Complex, Mumbai

Led the end-to-end quality assurance for a landmark G+40 story residential tower.

Championed the implementation of a digital workflow using BIM 360, which reduced the average issue resolution time by 30%.

Maintained a zero-failure rate for all high-strength concrete (M40 grade) pours through rigorous on-site testing and supplier audits.

KPMG India (Ajmera Associates) ‚Äî Associate Consultant

Conducted process audits and created compliance dashboards for KPI monitoring.

Automated Excel-based reporting to reduce manual errors and improve reporting accuracy.

Vijay InfraProjects Pvt. Ltd. ‚Äî Junior Engineer (QA/QC)

Performed quality control checks for concrete, steel, and finishing works.

Prepared quality inspection checklists, conducted site audits, and monitored contractor compliance.

Key Project: Commercial Building Finishing Works, Pune

Managed all QA/QC activities for the finishing stages of a large-scale commercial building, including plastering, tiling, and waterproofing.

Proactively identified, documented, and drove the closure of over 50 NCRs, coordinating corrective actions that prevented significant rework and ensured the project remained on its critical path.

üìä Data-Driven QA/QC in Action
I believe in moving beyond simple checklists to create and track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that drive real-world results. By using Excel and Power BI, I help teams stop reacting to problems and start preventing them. Here are some examples of KPIs I've developed and used:

1. Rework Index (RI)
What it Measures: The percentage of work that has to be redone, calculated as (Cost of Rework / Total Project Cost) x 100.

Impact: Identified a contractor with a high Rework Index (15%). By implementing a mandatory pre-work checklist, their RI dropped to 4%, saving an estimated ‚Çπ2 lakhs in costs.

2. Contractor Quality Score (CQS)
What it Measures: A weighted score for each contractor based on their First-Time Pass Rate, NCR Closure Rate, and material wastage.

Impact: Used historical CQS data to select a high-performing waterproofing vendor, resulting in zero leaks reported and preventing future costly repairs.

3. Inspection Response Time (IRT)
What it Measures: The average time for a contractor to rectify a defect after an NCR is issued.

Impact: Reduced the IRT for electrical works from 10 days to 3 days by identifying and resolving a procurement bottleneck, which streamlined the entire finishing workflow.
